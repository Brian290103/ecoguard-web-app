# EcoGuard Landing Page Content Plan

This document outlines the content and structure for the new EcoGuard landing page, drawing from the project's existing documentation. The goal is to create an informative, engaging, and visually appealing entry point for all user types.

## 1. Navigation Bar

A clean and sticky navigation bar will provide easy access to all key sections of the site.

    -   How It Works
    -   About Us
    -   Contact
-   **Buttons**:
    -   `Login` (for existing users)
    -   `Sign Up` (primary CTA, styled for emphasis)

## 2. Hero Section

This is the first thing visitors see. It needs to be impactful and clearly communicate EcoGuard's value proposition.

-   **Headline**: "Empower Your Community, Protect Our Planet."
-   **Sub-headline**: "The all-in-one platform to report environmental issues, connect with local heroes, and drive real, measurable change. Your action, amplified."

    -   **Primary Button**: "Join the Movement" (links to the sign-up page).
    -   **Secondary Button**: "See It in Action" (smooth-scrolls to the "How It Works" section).
