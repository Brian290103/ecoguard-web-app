# The Lifecycle of an EcoGuard Report

This document outlines the complete journey of a report within the EcoGuard application, from its creation by a user to its final resolution by an authority or organization.

## Report Statuses

A report progresses through a series of statuses, ensuring every issue is tracked from submission to resolution.

*   **`Submitted`**: The initial status when a report is created by a user.
*   **`Acknowledged`**: A local authority has recognized and confirmed the report.
*   **`In Progress`**: A local authority has started investigating or addressing the issue.
*   **`Escalated`**: The issue is deemed more serious and has been passed on to national or specialized authorities for handling.
*   **`Claimed`**: An organization has taken ownership of a report to coordinate a response.
*   **`Resolved`**: The issue has been addressed and fixed by the responsible entity.

## 1. Stage: Creation & Submission

The lifecycle begins with an **Eco-Citizen (General User)**.

1.  **Spot an Issue**: The user identifies an environmental issue (e.g., illegal dumping, a stray animal, pollution).
2.  **Create a Report**: Using the EcoGuard app, the user creates a new report with all necessary details (location, media, category, description, priority).
3.  **Submit**: The user submits the report. The report's initial status is set to **`Submitted`**.

## 2. Stage: Triage & Notification

Once submitted, the system's automated triage and notification process begins based on the report's priority.

*   **`High` Priority**: Immediate notifications are sent to relevant **Local Authorities** and **Organization Representatives**.
*   **`Medium` or `Low` Priority**: Notifications are sent only to relevant **Organization Representatives**.

## 3. Stage: Acknowledgment & Action

This stage involves the relevant entities reviewing and taking ownership of the report.

*   **Local Authority Action**:
    *   A Local Authority representative reviews the report and can update the status to **`Acknowledged`** to confirm receipt.
    *   Once they begin actively working on it, they update the status to **`In Progress`**.
    *   If the issue is more serious than anticipated, they can update the status to **`Escalated`**, which passes it to national or specialized authorities.
*   **Organization Action**:
    *   An Organization Representative monitors their dashboard for relevant reports (including escalated ones).
    *   To avoid duplicate efforts, an organization can **"Claim"** a report, which updates its status to **`Claimed`**. This signals that a specific entity has taken ownership.

## 4. Stage: Resolution

This is the core stage where the issue is actively addressed by the responsible entity (a Local Authority or a claiming Organization).

1.  **Work is Performed**: The entity takes the necessary actions to resolve the issue.
2.  **Status Updates**: Throughout the process, the entity can post comments or update the status to keep everyone informed.
3.  **Issue Resolved**: Once the work is complete, the entity updates the report's status to **`Resolved`**.

## 5. Stage: Verification

The final stage ensures transparency and closes the feedback loop.

1.  **Submit Completion Report**: Upon setting the status to `Resolved`, the representative provides a summary of actions taken and evidence of the resolution (e.g., before-and-after photos).
2.  **Notify Reporter**: The original user who submitted the report receives a final notification, informing them that the issue has been resolved.
3.  **Public Record**: The report, along with its resolution details, becomes part of the public record on the platform.

This lifecycle ensures that every report is seen, triaged, assigned, and resolved in a structured and transparent manner, empowering communities to make a measurable impact on their environment.
