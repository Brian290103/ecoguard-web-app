# 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the requirements for EcoGuard, a cross-platform application (mobile app and responsive web application) designed to empower users in environmental conservation. The app addresses global environmental challenges by providing tools for issue reporting, education, community collaboration, and personal impact tracking. By leveraging software technologies, EcoGuard aims to foster awareness, encourage sustainable practices, and enable collective action without relying on external hardware dependencies.

The primary goal is to create a user-centric platform that bridges technology and activism, aligning with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). This PRD serves as a blueprint for development teams, ensuring clarity on features, scope, and success criteria.

### 1.2 Scope
**In Scope**:
- Development of a mobile app using React Native Expo.
- Development of a responsive web app using Next.js for cross-device compatibility.
- Core features: Environmental issue reporting, educational resources, community collaboration, and conservation tools.
- Backend services for data handling, user authentication, and real-time updates, powered by the Next.js web app.
- Integration with geolocation APIs (software-based, e.g., Google Maps API) for location tagging.
- Integration with Stream API for community chats and events.
- Integration with Zoom API for external video calling services.
- Gamification elements to enhance user engagement.

**Out of Scope**:
- Hardware integrations (e.g., no sensors or device-specific peripherals).
- Physical infrastructure monitoring or satellite data processing.
- E-commerce or monetization features (e.g., in-app purchases beyond basic subscriptions if added later).

### 1.3 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Users have access to standard smartphones or web browsers with internet connectivity.
- Third-party APIs (e.g., for maps, weather data, chat, video) are available and compliant with privacy regulations.
- Development assumes an agile methodology with sprints for iterative feedback.
- Dependencies include open-source libraries for frontend/backend and compliance with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

### 1.4 Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Low user adoption due to competition. **Mitigation**: Differentiate through integrated gamification and AI-driven personalization.
- **Risk**: Data privacy concerns with user reports. **Mitigation**: Implement anonymized reporting and end-to-end encryption.
- **Risk**: Scalability issues with growing user base. **Mitigation**: Use cloud auto-scaling and monitor performance metrics.
