## Chapter 3: Report Management and Action

### 3.1 Claiming a Report
1.  When an Organization Representative identifies a report their organization can address, they can "Claim" it.
2.  Claiming a report notifies other stakeholders (General Users, Local Authorities) that their organization is taking responsibility for the issue.

### 3.2 Taking Action and Updating Status
1.  The representative updates the report's status (e.g., "Investigation Underway," "Action Planned," "In Progress").
2.  They can add internal notes for their team and communicate with the General User who submitted the report for more details.
3.  This may involve deploying teams, conducting research, or coordinating with other entities.

### 3.3 Publishing Completion Reports
1.  Once the organization has addressed and resolved the environmental issue.
2.  The representative updates the report's status to "Resolved."
3.  They are prompted to post a comprehensive completion report, including:
    -   A detailed summary of the actions taken and outcomes.
    -   Relevant post-intervention photos or videos.
    -   Confirmation of the resolution date.
    -   Any educational insights gained from the intervention.
