## Chapter 3: Core Application Usage

### 3.1 The Dashboard

2.  It displays a personalized feed of activity, including:
    -   A map showing recent issue reports in their area.
    -   A feed of recent community discussions.
    -   Their current "Personal Impact Score" and recently earned badges.

### 3.2 Reporting an Issue
1.  The user taps the "Report New Issue" button.
2.  The app automatically captures the user's current location (which can be adjusted manually).
3.  The user uploads photos or videos of the issue.
4.  The user selects a category (e.g., "Illegal Dumping," "Pollution," "Stray Animal") and adds a detailed description.
5.  The user selects a priority level for the report (High, Medium, or Low). This selection helps determine the notification workflow (i.e., whether to immediately alert Local Authorities or notify relevant Organizations).

## Chapter 4: Community and Engagement

### 4.3 Automatic Community Grouping
To foster local engagement, the system automatically groups users into location-based communities.

1.  **Location-Based Matching**: When a user registers or updates their location, the system checks for other users within a predefined radius (e.g., 1 KM).
2.  **Automatic Community Creation**:
    -   If a user is near one or more other users but not yet part of a local community, the system automatically creates a new community for that geographic area.
    -   All users within that radius are then invited to join this new community.
3.  **Joining Existing Communities**: If a community already exists for the user's location, they are automatically prompted to join it.
